## What are the different ways to create variables?

Three main keywords to create variables in JavaScript

### let keyword

Lets you declare a variable that 

* Does not hoist values to the top at the time of declaration
* Does throw error if you use it before the declaration
* Does confine the scope of the value to within the block \(if or for etc\)
* Allows you to modify the value like how `var` does.
